let hero;
function gethero(){
    return true;
}
hero=gethero();//here any is assigned




let heroo:string;
function getheroo(){
    return "Ball";
}
heroo=getheroo();//here string is assigned therefore will show error if anything other than string is returned to it 


//any is most prefereable not to use and it would only decrease the pawer of typescript so better use js if you always want to use any type in every other code of yours
